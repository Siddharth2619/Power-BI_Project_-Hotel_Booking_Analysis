Worked on a project where I analyzed Hotel Booking Data to provide actionable recommendations on where    the stakeholders should consider opening new branches to tap into potential growth opportunities. 
The project involved using SQL, Excel & data visualization tools such as Power BI to analyze whether revenue    was increasing year-over-year and identified factors that may be contributing to changes in revenue in areas where the business could expand to increase profitability.
